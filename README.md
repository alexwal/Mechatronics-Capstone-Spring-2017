There are two main components to our project: mechanical design and software implementation. We used three servo motors to control the movement of the robot arms, as well as two DC motors to control the shifting of paper. Our software linearizes the full forward kinematics of the robot, which we use to output joint velocities, and convert to servo positions. The software was embedded on an Arduino UNO microcontroller and the hardware was constructed with laser cut wood pieces and screws.
