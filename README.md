- There are two main components to our project: mechanical design and software implementation. 

- We used three servo motors to control the movement of the robot arms, as well as two DC motors to control the shifting of paper. 

- Our software linearizes the full forward kinematics of the robot, which we use to output joint velocities, and convert to servo positions. The software was embedded on an Arduino UNO microcontroller.

- We laser cut our own robot body and enclosure, connecting everything with screws and hot glue.

- All required code and fabrication files are hosted here on Github.
